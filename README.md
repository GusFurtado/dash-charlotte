# Dash Charlotte

A package of themes, tools and components that I use on my Plotly-Dash web applications.

This is still a super early work in progress and probably not very interesting, so don't waste your time here.

## Submodules

- **Components**

Some Dash components for fast dashboard building.

- **Themes**

Colors, fonts, icon packages and CSS stuff.

- **Layouts**

Some pre-built page layouts.

## Instatlation

By `pip` in a near future.
